## About Me

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at NIU. Previously, I attended the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign for Nuclear/Plasma Engineering and minored in Computer Science for three years. Although I didn't complete my degree at UIUC, transferring to NIU allowed me to fully focus on my passion for computer science. My ultimate goal is to specialize in graphics programming with APIs like Vulkan or DirectX, contributing to the video game industry that has always inspired me.

## Projects
### [Game Scheduling Web App](https://github.com/robalobalubob/my-pathfinder-scheduler)
#### [Website hosted with Vercel](https://gamescheduler3000.vercel.app/)
A web app developed with Next.js. The intent with this app is to assist with scheduling Pathfinder sessions by having players submit their availability for the GM.
The GM can then view all availabilities and schedule a session. Users would then receive an email with a calendar link. The calendar on the website's homepage is also updated with the new session.
- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Database:** Supabase

### [Fullstack Web Application (csci467Project)](https://github.com/robalobalubob/csci467Project)
A complete fullstack web application built with:
- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Database:** MySQL  
Designed to handle quote creation, editing, and viewing through three distinct interfaces: one for field associates, one for quote editing/sending, and another for administration.

### [Blackjack Game in Godot (blackjackGodot)](https://github.com/robalobalubob/blackjackGodot)
A side project to get acquainted with Godot. Developed a blackjack game where the game logic was implemented in GDScript.

### [Chess Board (chessBoard)](https://github.com/robalobalubob/chessBoard)
Collaboratively built a chessboard application using Win32 and Direct2D.

### [Data Visualization Project](https://robalobalubob.github.io/data-vis-final/)
For my CSCI 627 Data Visualization course, I developed a visualization using:
- **JavaScript**
- **D3.js**
- **Leaflet**
- **Observable Notebooks**
The project analyzes Illinois hospital report card data to answer questions regarding:
- The impact of location on median procedure costs.
- The variation of median costs with patient volume.
- Differences in cost based on hospital ownership types.
