## About Me

I am deeply dedicated to solving problems and believe that every challenge represents an invaluable opportunity to learn. Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have been recognized for my perseverance, attention to detail, and commitment to delivering high-quality results, qualities noted by my mentors and managers. My approach is to understand and recreate complex systems from first principles, rather than simply relying on the latest frameworks or toolkits.

My passion for visual computing was ignited when I implemented the marching cubes algorithm from scratch. Navigating the intricacies of the graphics pipeline and overcoming its technical challenges was both enlightening and formative, affirming my desire to pursue advanced study and research in the field.

## Professional Experience

### Wahl Clipper Corporation - R&D Software Engineering Intern
- **Android Application Development:**
Solely designed and developed an internal Android application to accompany new hardware. The initial implementation used traditional Bluetooth, but I successfully migrated the communication layer to BLE after the hardware specification changed. This migration required rapid, in-depth learning of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol and its integration within Android.
  - Built the entire application architecture from the ground up, with no legacy codebase.
  - Developed robust Bluetooth/BLE data acquisition features for high-speed communication with custom hardware.
  - Engineered a reactive 3D model viewer using OpenGL ES, with a strong focus on physically based rendering (PBR) shaders. Invested significant effort into shader development to achieve high-quality, visually appealing 3D model rendering.
- **Object Detection and Tracking (Python, OpenCV, YOLO):**
Independently designed a pipeline for automated object detection and tracking, focusing on hair clippers as the primary object of interest.
  - Leveraged the YOLO detection model, currently training on thousands of annotated images of hair clippers to improve detection accuracy for real-world use cases.
  - Developed a custom tracking solution utilizing a modified Hungarian algorithm combined with a Kalman filter for robust object tracking across video frames.
  - Performed initial validation through video review; the resulting data will play a critical role in determining the suitability of future automated testing frameworks.
