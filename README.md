# Hi there, I'm Robby Williams

I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from NIU, passionate about graphics programming, visual computing, and video games. My academic journey concluded with a GPA of 3.64, and I'm actively preparing to continue my education by applying to PhD programs focusing on visual computing and computer vision.

## About Me

I recently graduated from Northern Illinois University (NIU) with a degree in Computer Science, previously attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for Nuclear/Plasma Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. At NIU, I specialized in computer graphics, rendering, and modeling, building foundational expertise in advanced visual computing techniques.

My ultimate goal is to deepen my knowledge and research capabilities in graphics programming, particularly with APIs like Vulkan or DirectX, and to contribute meaningfully to visual computing research and the video game industry.
