# Hi there, I'm Robby Williams

## Current Focus

- Actively exploring and evaluating graduate programs in visual computing, with a focus on computer graphics and computer vision.
- Advancing my mastery of the Vulkan API and strengthening my understanding of low-level graphics programming.
- Developing projects in computer vision, including hands-on work with OpenCV and ongoing experimentation in pose recognition.
- Building a [portfolio](https://robalobalubob.github.io/portfolio/) that demonstrates both technical depth and creativity in graphics and vision.

## Professional Experience

### Wahl Clipper Corporation - R&D Software Engineering Intern
- **Android Application Development:**
Solely designed and developed an internal Android application to accompany new hardware. The initial implementation used traditional Bluetooth, but I successfully migrated the communication layer to BLE after the hardware specification changed. This migration required rapid, in-depth learning of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol and its integration within Android.
  - Built the entire application architecture from the ground up, with no legacy codebase.
  - Developed robust Bluetooth/BLE data acquisition features for high-speed communication with custom hardware.
  - Engineered a reactive 3D model viewer using OpenGL ES, with a strong focus on physically based rendering (PBR) shaders. Invested significant effort into shader development to achieve high-quality, visually appealing 3D model rendering.
- **Object Detection and Tracking (Python, OpenCV, YOLO):**
Independently designed a pipeline for automated object detection and tracking, focusing on hair clippers as the primary object of interest.
  - Leveraged the YOLO detection model, currently training on thousands of annotated images of hair clippers to improve detection accuracy for real-world use cases.
  - Developed a custom tracking solution utilizing a modified Hungarian algorithm combined with a Kalman filter for robust object tracking across video frames.
  - Performed initial validation through video review; the resulting data will play a critical role in determining the suitability of future automated testing frameworks.
